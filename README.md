# GDetectio App
Guava plant disease detection application using deep learning

## Project Overview
Agriculture plays a very significant role in the day today lives around the world. The agriculture 
domain goes through many challenges like nutrition deficiencies, climate changes etc. Plant 
diseases are the biggest threat to the agriculture domain. It is an absolute necessity to protect these 
plant from these diseases that may result in massive crop and economic losses. These challenges 
can be overcome by identifying and controlling the problem at an early stage, but the identification 
should be accurate.A deep learning-based approach is proposed in this research and to classify the guava plant diseases using a combined dataset. Out of 
many pre-trained models in Keras, DenseNet 121 was chosen for the initial implementation 
considering the requirement elicitation methodologies.
